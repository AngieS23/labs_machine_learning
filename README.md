# Laboratories Machine Learning

## Laboratory 1: Exploratory data analysis

This laboratory consisted in realizing an EDA to a [protate cancer](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=prad_mich) dataset.

To see the results obtained visit [Laboratory_1](./lab1_exploratory_data_analysis/Laboratory_1.ipynb).

## Laboratory 2: Supervised learning

This laboratory consisted in using different supervised learning algorithms to solve the classification of [red wine](https://doi.org/10.24432/C56S3T) based on the quality. The algorithms selected where `Support Vector machine (SVM)`, `k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)`, `Random Forest`, `Gaussian Processes` and `XGBoost`.
